# Qdrant v1.0 Roadmap

Hi!
This document is our plan for Qdrant development till its first enterprise-ready release. 

Goals of the release:

* **Make API and Storage stable** - ensure backward compatibility for at least one major version back.
  * Staring for the release, breaking changes in API should only be done with a proper deprecation notice
  * Storage should be compatible between any two consequent major versions
* **Achieve horizontal scalability** - distributed deployment able to serve billions of points
* **Easy integration** - make the user experience as smooth as possible
* **Resource efficiency** - push Qdrant performance on the single machine to the limit

To build a solid foundation for future development, we decided to keep Qdrant as legacy-free as possible.
That means that while switching to `v1.0`, some breaking changes are likely.

ETA of `v1.0-rc` is Q2 2022
